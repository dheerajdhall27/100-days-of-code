# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 24, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Javascript, Specifically on ES6.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/dheerajdhall27/100-days-of-code/tree/master/src/Day0

**Thoughts:** I am fairly new to Javascript and trying to understand the syntax. The flexibility of using variables can cause problems when writing code. ES6 fixes most of the problems. I have listed few of the thing down.

The coding for today involved running through the FreeCodeCamp curriculum for ES6. I compiled all that I learned in one file
and saved it in the src folder.

1) Difference Between var and let (let is much more stricter and reduces the variable to a scope, var declares it as global)
2) Objects assigned using const are mutable. Ex: Arrays and Functions.
3) Inline functions do not need a name
4) Arrow functions don't require a return Keyword
5) ES6 introduces default parameters
6) Spread operator (...args) only works inline, as args to function or array literals.
7) Array can be destructured using ..spread operator

### Day 1: February 25, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: Worked on two frontend projects. A step towards Frontend certification from freecodecamp.

                  2) https://codepen.io/dheerajdhall/pen/GRJWZJX

**Thoughts:** Getting better at frontend technologies. But, should use React for the frontend development.

The code is available on the pens linked above, the src folder will not consist of any code for this project.

1) Learned about Form validation.
2) Used card class to create the form layout. (Very useful)

There was not a lot of new concepts that I learned today, but started work on two mini projects.

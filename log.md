# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 24, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Javascript, Specifically on ES6.

**Link to work**: https://github.com/dheerajdhall27/100-days-of-code/tree/master/src/Day0

**Thoughts:** I am fairly new to Javascript and trying to understand the syntax. The flexibility of using variables can cause problems when writing code. ES6 fixes most of the problems. I have listed few of the thing down.

The coding for today involved running through the FreeCodeCamp curriculum for ES6. I compiled all that I learned in one file
and saved it in the src folder.

1) Difference Between var and let (let is much more stricter and reduces the variable to a scope, var declares it as global)
2) Objects assigned using const are mutable. Ex: Arrays and Functions.
3) Inline functions do not need a name
4) Arrow functions don't require a return Keyword
5) ES6 introduces default parameters
6) Spread operator (...args) only works inline, as args to function or array literals.
7) Array can be destructured using ..spread operator

### Day 1: February 25, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: Worked on two frontend projects. A step towards Frontend certification from freecodecamp.

                  2) https://codepen.io/dheerajdhall/pen/GRJWZJX

**Thoughts:** Getting better at frontend technologies. But, should use React for the frontend development.

The code is available on the pens linked above, the src folder will not consist of any code for this project.

1) Learned about Form validation.
2) Used card class to create the form layout. (Very useful)

There was not a lot of new concepts that I learned today, but started work on two mini projects.

### Day 2: February 26, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: Finished the second Frontend project for the certification on freecodecamp. Started work on the Third Project

                  2) https://codepen.io/dheerajdhall/full/eYNvoZb

**Thoughts:** Need to focus on CSS and learn about flex and media queries

The code is available on the pens linked above, the src folder will not consist of any code for this project.

****************************************************************************************************************************************
### Day 3: February 27, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: Finished the Module on ES6 on FreeCodecamp. Read about REST services, React and Redux

**Link to work**: Spent reading about technologies. The coding for today was mainly on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** The modularity approach of react makes it very easy to create components that can be re-used.
              ES6 makes it easy to write code by approaching OOP standards.

The src folder for today would be empty.

### Day 4: February 28, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the third project for the front end certification.

**Link to work**: https://codepen.io/dheerajdhall/pen/eYNvoZb

**Thoughts:** Could not figure out How to align the image and nav bar inside header. Added the basic functionality required in the 
              project.

****************************************************************************************************************************************
### Day 5: February 29, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: Worked on the third project for the front end certification. Finished the basic requirements. Need to work on alignment and media queries

**Link to work**: https://codepen.io/dheerajdhall/full/eYNvoZb

**Thoughts:** Front end is easy and hard at the same time. Can be a bit annoying. I love backend for sure.

****************************************************************************************************************************************
### Day 6: March 1, 2020 
**Today's Progress**: Finished the Third project and made it completely responsive.

**Link to work**: https://codepen.io/dheerajdhall/full/eYNvoZb

**Thoughts:** It is fun and frustrating working with frontend. I think I am developing a love-hate relationship.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 24, 2020 (Example 1)
**Today's Progress**: Worked on Javascript, Specifically on ES6.

**Thoughts:** I am fairly new to Javascript and trying to understand the syntax. The flexibility of using variables can cause problems when writing code. ES6 fixes most of the problems. I have listed few of the thing down.

The coding for today involved running through the FreeCodeCamp curriculum for ES6. I compiled all that I learned in one file
and saved it in the src folder.

1) Difference Between var and let (let is much more stricter and reduces the variable to a scope, var declares it as global)
2) Objects assigned using const are mutable. Ex: Arrays and Functions.
3) Inline functions do not need a name
4) Arrow functions don't require a return Keyword
5) ES6 introduces default parameters
6) Spread operator (...args) only works inline, as args to function or array literals.
7) Array can be destructured using ..spread operator
